# Phantom-Based CT Radiomics Robustness and Generalizability

This repository contains the analysis notebooks and PyRadiomics parameter file used for the study:

**Phantom-Based Benchmarking of Computed Tomography Radiomics Robustness and Generalizability Under Kernel, Exposure, and Edge Distortion**

The workflow evaluates CT radiomic feature robustness using the CC-Radiomics-Phantom-2 dataset, identifies stable radiomic features using coefficient of variation (CV) and Susceptibility Index (SI), quantifies kernel-associated volumetric edge distortion, and transfers the resulting feature subsets to the NSCLC-Radiomics Lung1 dataset for downstream machine learning evaluation.

## Repository Contents

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `1_updated_phantom_cv_si.ipynb` | Main phantom robustness notebook. Builds or loads the CCR phantom DICOM metadata index, defines layer-specific phantom ROIs, performs registration-based mask propagation and HU-based refinement, extracts radiomic features, computes CV and SI, identifies Stable features, summarizes feature-class composition, generates robustness plots, and performs volumetric edge-distortion analysis. |
| `2_updated_lung1_extraction_clean.ipynb` | Lung1 extraction notebook. Audits local Lung1 DICOM and RTSTRUCT files, joins clinical and imaging metadata, applies the same PyRadiomics extraction settings used in the phantom phase, and exports the cleaned Lung1 radiomic feature matrix for machine learning. |
| `3_updated_ml_lda.ipynb` | Machine learning notebook. Loads phantom-derived stability results and Lung1 radiomic features, constructs the All, Stable, and Stable no-shape feature sets, evaluates Logistic Regression, SVM (RBF), Random Forest, and MLP under baseline, kernel-shift, and vendor-shift settings, and generates performance plots. LDA is included only as an optional exploratory visualization and is not part of the final manuscript results. |
| `params_clean_updated.yaml` | PyRadiomics parameter file used consistently for phantom and Lung1 feature extraction. Settings include Original image features only, 25 HU fixed bin width, 3D extraction, -700 to +2000 HU resegmentation, and 1 × 1 × 1 mm³ isotropic resampling. |

## Public Datasets

The raw imaging datasets are not included in this repository. They are publicly available from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA):

1. **CC-Radiomics-Phantom-2**  
   Used for phantom-based robustness screening, CV/SI analysis, and volumetric edge-distortion analysis.  
   https://doi.org/10.7937/TCIA.2019.4l24tz5g

2. **NSCLC-Radiomics (Lung1)**  
   Used for downstream clinical radiomics extraction and machine learning evaluation.  
   https://doi.org/10.7937/K9/TCIA.2015.PF0M9REI

## Required Software

The analysis was developed using Python 3.10.11. The main Python packages used include:

- NumPy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- PyRadiomics 3.0.1
- SimpleITK
- pydicom
- rt-utils
- tqdm

The notebooks assume that the raw TCIA datasets have been downloaded locally and that the path variables near the beginning of each notebook have been updated to match the local directory structure.

## Workflow Summary

1. Download the CC-Radiomics-Phantom-2 and NSCLC-Radiomics Lung1 datasets from TCIA.
2. Update the local path configuration cells in each notebook.
3. Run `1_updated_phantom_cv_si.ipynb` to generate the CCR phantom metadata index, extracted phantom features, CV/SI robustness tables, Stable feature list, and volumetric edge-distortion outputs.
4. Run `2_updated_lung1_extraction_clean.ipynb` to generate the Lung1 radiomic feature matrix using the same PyRadiomics settings.
5. Run `3_updated_ml_lda.ipynb` to evaluate the All, Stable, and Stable no-shape feature sets under baseline, reconstruction-kernel shift, and vendor-shift machine learning settings.

## Feature Sets

- **All features:** Complete 107-feature PyRadiomics feature matrix.
- **Stable:** Phantom-derived features satisfying both CV and SI stability criteria.
- **Stable no-shape:** Stable feature subset after removing all shape descriptors.

## Notes on Reproducibility

- The Stable and Stable no-shape feature sets are derived only from the CCR phantom dataset.
- Lung1 outcome labels are not used during phantom-based feature selection.
- Median imputation and Z-score scaling in machine learning are fitted only on the training fold or training split, then applied to validation or test data.
- The workflow is IBSI-aligned through fixed and documented extraction settings, but it was not formally IBSI-validated against benchmark reference values.
